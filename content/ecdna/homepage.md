## Common features of ecDNA in cancer
- [Circular and double-stranded DNA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31748743/)
- [Does not contain a centromere or a telomere](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30872802/)
- [Highly amplified in many cancers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32807987/)
- [Carries major oncogenes and regulatory domains](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33836152/)
- [Its amplification is highly relevant to poor patient outcomes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32807987/)
- [Unevenly inherited to the next generation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34819316/)
- [Form its own cluster in the nucleus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34819316/) and [act as transctriptional hotspot](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34819668/)
